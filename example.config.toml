# Shell commands exposed as tools to the agent.
# Each [[commands]] block becomes a callable tool.

#   description — shown to the agent so it knows when to use it
#   command     — shell command to execute
#   timeout     — max seconds before killing the process (default: 120)
#   confirm     — if true, agent must ask an authorized user before running (default: false)
#
# Add your own commands below. Here are some examples:
