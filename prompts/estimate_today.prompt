Start by fetching today's calendar events and the todo file.

Your job is to read both and produce a realistic schedule for the day:

1. Calendar events are fixed — treat them as immovable blocks.
2. For each unfinished todo, provide a time estimate. Feel free to split tasks into subtasks for better accuracy.
3. Schedule work in 1h pomodoro sessions squeezed between calendar events. If a gap between events is too short for a full pomodoro use that for stuff like grocerie shopping or going out with the dog.
4. If tasks are not clear enough (and only then!) ask clarifying questions one task at a time.
5. Keep things simple and tidy. Stick to the format (see below)

1hour == 1p 
marinating tasks " - [m]" dont get a estimate or a start time
tasks that include "#fb" are important and should be scheduled for the beggining of the day 
events with ">>" in the title means we are traveling somewhere. Tasks can be planned during that but should be simple and not require internet. Nothing shoul dbe scheduled after traveling events. 


expected output:

# todo
- [m] send email
- [ ] create website start:10:30 p:3
	- [ ] frontend p:1
	- [ ] backend p:1 #fb
	- [ ] integration tests p:1
- [ ] clean p:1
- [ ] send taxtes

# Events 
10:30 work on website
14:00 go to market + go out wiht kika
15:00 lunch 
16:00 relaxing bath or gaming
20:00 datenight

IMPORTANT: DO NOT PRODUCE ANYTHING ELSE. NO RAW DATA. NO PLANNING STAGE. NOTHING! Only output todo and events as described above!
